Modern High performance AOP and Coroutine PHP Framework, base on Swoole 2

The first modern high-performance full-stack framework with coroutine based on Swoole 2.0, with coroutine network server and client inside, which is based on asynchronous non-blocking I/O technique, resident memory, independent of conventional php-fpm mode. It can be used like a synchronous client, no complex asyn callback, no tedious yield, but like go coroutine. It also provides flexible annontations, global dependency injection container, perfect soa governance, aop,standard PSR rules and so on which is used for builing high-performance web system, apis, middleware and basic service.
